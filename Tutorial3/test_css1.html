    Usually, CSS is written in a separate CSS file or in a style tag inside of 
    the head tag, but there is a third place which is also valid. The third place 
    you can write CSS is inside of an HTML tag, using the style attribute</p>
    
    <p id="para2">Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add style tag in the head 
    section of your HTML document. This CSS style is an effective method of 
    styling a single page</p>
    
    <p class="para3">External CSS contains separate CSS file which contains only style 
    property with the help of tag attributes. CSS property written in a separate 
    file with css extension and should be linked to the HTML document using 
    link tag</p>
